# examples
This repo contains relevant code examples I use in my blog posting or just to validate various tech stack. Feel free to use them in whatever way you like for your learning.

To clone only a specific folder from examples repo to your machine  follow the steps below
  - git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/tanwarsatya/examples.git
  - cd examples
  - git sparse-checkout init --cone
  - git sparse-checkout set **sample**

This will clone the example repo but only fetch limited content from the ***sample*** directory.
